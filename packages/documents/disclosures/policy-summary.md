It's an incredibly complex world out there, and we're here to simplify it. Below you'll find some of our core beliefs on data retention, written in plain language. A language that you should have no issue in relating to.

But if you find it too complex, feel free to reach out to [support@heatherturanocoaching.com](support@heatherturanocoaching.com) and we'll be happy to help you come to a solid understanding on our values.

# The short of it

We respect your **privacy**, **data**, and **person**. That is why we will never sell any of your data or the analytics that we track to any 3rd party providers. All the information collected here is retained by us. We specifically do everything we can to ensure that the data used to interact with our web content is hosted by us and managed by us.

We self host all of our content, our services, our databases, our analytics and our APIs. The only thing that we don't host ourselves is how we store our code and how we process your credit cards. And let's be honest, if they were easy things to do, you could be sure that we would try to do it ourselves.

This gives us the most visibility and understanding on your digital footprint with Heather Turano Coaching, LLC's web services.

# Why we believe in your security

There are reasons that there are so many ad blockers out there as well as browsers that are based upon privacy. Each time you visit a website, there are a whole number of pixel trackers, cookies, statistics engines, reporting mechanisms that all spin up at once and then track your movement.

They can then use the data, paired with a unique identifier and then _sell_ that data to 3rd party data providers. So anyone who has a high traffic website can profit off of the way you use that website, without you ever buying anything!

We don't do that. We only track you for 2 specific reasons:

1. Make your experience better
2. Pre-emptively get notified when the web app experiences an error

That's it. We won't sell your online sole to Google and we definitely won't allow them access to it. To that point, our services are hosted on virtual private servers where outside access is tightly controlled.

We protect you, because when it comes to the modern web, it's very hard to protect yourself.

# Your data, your decisions

Since we host all of our services, we host all of your data. Since we host all of your data, we can have a full understanding of where it all exists.

So if you ever want to get a copy or know more about the places it's stored, we can easily produce that for you. If you want to request to delete it, you can.

# Our profits don't rely on your data

We make money exclusively through our services. What you pay for is how we make money. We won't be surfacing advertisements because we believe in a wholesome web experience; one that isn't marred by popups and tricky UI elements trying to get you to subscribe.

We use Stripe to process your credit cards and that's about it. We're focused on your security so that's why we offload all credit processing to another third party.

# At the end of the day

We believe that the web can be better. We believe in providing you the best experience possible and that experience means putting control back into your hands about your data, your exposure and your well being.

**Namastae,**

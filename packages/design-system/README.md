# Typesafe Design System

## Features

- **CSS-in-JS Library Agnostic** - Seeing as these are only typed variables and configuration values, we can easily use this in any CSS-in-JS library. We like `styled-components` & `styled-jsx` & `emotion`

## Todo

- [ ] If a `em` is used in the `makeSize` utility, we need to require a `baseValue` to be passed into the function

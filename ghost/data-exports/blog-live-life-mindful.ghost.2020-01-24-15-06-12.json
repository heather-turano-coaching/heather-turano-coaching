When we barely even know who he is and if we even want to actually date him. At this stage of dating you should be testing him out. **Your attitude should be \\\"why do you deserve me\\\".** You need to show him that you have an abundant amount of potential men you could be dating in your back pocket and he is the lucky one you are giving a chance to. And if he can’t show up at the level you are at, than it's on to the next one!\\nAt this beginning stage you really should be just sitting back and watching who he is, how he treats you, and how he treats other people. Remember until maybe the 3rd date he is a complete stranger. Ladies, You can’t be in love with a man this early in the game. Control your feelings, protect your hearts and have high standards for the men that you decide to date.\\n## Mistake #2: Do not drop your life for a man you just started dating\\nThe second mistake I see is, woman tend to drop their life for a date. For example when a girl starts dating a guy she likes, what does she usually do? Stops hanging out with friends, sits by her phone waiting to be asked out, clears her calendar just in-case he wants to go out on Saturday. NOOOOOO…. **Remember your life is full**. This person has not proven that they are worth you canceling plans or even having a weekend date yet. Those weekend “holy days” if you will, are for really special people in your life! **Do not cancel your plans for a man that you just started dating,** in-fact if he calls on Thursday and asks you out Friday night, let him know you already have plans. Tell him that if he wants to go out, it is usually better to plan something with you in advance because your schedule books up fast. **Set your standards from the beginning.** If he is the man for you he will respect that and ask you out for Saturday night.\\n## Mistake #3: Do not sleep with them\\nMistake number three, Oh Ladies and this is a doozy, **do not sleep with them**. I think woman sometimes think that a guy will not stay unless you sleep with them after the third date. I say, isn’t it better if on date three, you say good night with a kiss and see if he calls you and asks you out for date 4?\\nThere are no rules on this. I have waited and not waited but the fact is. If you sleep with them that doesn’t mean they will commit to you. Wait until you are in a committed relationship. Then you both have decided that it is worth the next step and you protect yourself from a lot more pain if it doesn't end up working out.\\n## I will close this post with some little tid-bits of brilliant insight\\n**Men need to feel like you are a challenge.** They need to feel like you don’t just go out with anyone that asks for your number. They need to feel like they are special because you chose to give them a chance. Let them fight for your time, let them wonder if you like them, let them chase you and show you they are worthy of you.\\n**Stay in that beautiful feminine energy.** Just sit back, be open, relaxed, and light. Let them take care of you. If he is the right man. He will rise to the challenge and do the work. If he is the wrong man, he will fall away, and it is your job to let him.\\n**There is no need to convince anyone to be with you.** If you start convincing some one to be with you now, that will be the pattern of your relationship, and who wants that? you will see who is right and who is wrong if you just lean back, observe his actions and except who they are at face value, not who you want them to be.\\n# What mistakes have you made in the past when first dating some one?\\nShare your story, experience or comments below!

They use manipulation to breakdown the self worth, self\nconfidence, and over all identity of those who are the closest to them. Leaving\nthe victim feeling crazy, lost, and having no idea what reality is.\n\nIf you are in a relationship that makes you feel crazy, you could be dealing\nwith a Covert Narcissist.\n\nHere are 4 manipulation tactics Narcissist use to emotionally abuse and\nmanipulate their victims.\n\nGaslighting\nGaslighting is a form of mental abuse. This is when the abuser makes the victim\nsecond guess reality and doubt their own memory, feelings, or events.\n\nAn example of gaslighting could look something like this. You Ask your partner\nto make the bed and start to pitch in with house work more because you are\noverwhelmed and need his help. When you walk in your bedroom to go to bed you\nnotice the bed is neatly made and his pillows are nicely places on his side of\nthe bed.

I totally forgot i got side tracked I will go up and do it right\nnow\". Gaslighting is when a manipulator does something on purpose to make the\nvictim doubt themselves and start to think they are crazy and over reacting.\nWhen in all reality the abuser is slowly starting to twist the victim in a web\nof confusion and invalidate their reality.\n\nProjection\nWhen dealing with a person with NPD be aware of projection. This tactic is when\nthe abuser will project onto you who they actually are and how they think.\n\nFor example when you are having a conversation or most likely and argument with\nthe abusive party. And he starts to tell you how selfish you are; or that you\ndon't care about him; or that he is absolutely sure you are cheating on him.\nThat is purely a projection of the things he is capable of doing or already\ndoing.\n\nBecause you are a normal functioning person you wonder why he is thinking this\nabout you. So, you try to change and convince him you are not this person by\nbeing less selfish and catering more to his needs and showing him even more that\nyou care about him by not arguing or hiding your feelings. You may start to not\ngo out with friends because he is saying you are cheating on him. You start to\nchange and twist yourself to prove you are a good person when all the while the\nperson he was talking about was never you. It was his projection of himself onto\nyou.\n\nThe silent treatment\nAhhhh... the good old silent treatment. We all do this from time to time but not\nin the way toxic emotional abusers use it. They know connecting and conversation\nis what their victims crave most so by taking that away they take away the\nvictims voice, their need to be heard and validated.\n\nAn example of the silent treatment may look like this. You want to discuss\nsomething with your partner and it turns into a fight. Your partner then leaves\nthe conversation and does not tell you why or when you both can discuss this\ntopic again.

Losing their voice and their own opinions which in\nturn makes them start to lose their sense of \"Self\". Over time the silent\ntreatment can make people feel like they are walking on egg shells around their\npartner and they do not matter.\n\nAggressive jabs disguised as jokes\nWhen you have to hurt someone to make a joke, it isn't a joke. Aggressive jabs\nat people you \"supposedly love\" are a way to make the abuser feel superior to\nthe people around them. Narcissists do this a lot, because they have such\nfragile egos and self esteem. They need to put others down to make sure they\nfeel more confident and feed their ego. We call this \"narcissistic supply\".\n\nA great example of aggressive jabs may be if you get dressed up for an evening\nout and you come downstairs in hopes your partner will tell you how wonderful\nyou look.

This is so the\nNarcissist can feel superior and break down the confidence of the healthy\nindividual over time. Causing the victim to lose their sense of self worth\nslowly over time.\n\nSome other emotional abuse tactics not discuss in this post are\n 1. Destructive conditioning\n 2. Boundary testing and hovering\n 3. Control\n 4. Aggressive Conditioning\n\nIf you are interested in these behaviors leave me a message and I will post in\nmore detail about them.\n\nWhat other manipulation tactics have you or some one close to you experienced?\n\nAs always leave a comment or questions on your experience below.

            "plaintext": "Pairing meditation with Mudras\nMeditation is a wonderful way to begin and end each day.\n\nDepending on what we need that day or time in our lives, we can use meditation\nto alter the way our body and mind feels. It can also help us react better to\nour circumstances.\n\nDo you want to feel more accepting, free, grounded, less anxious? Well there is\nmost likely a meditation for that.\n\nAnd with that mediation, there is also probably a mudra we can pair with it.\n\nThis partnership of mediation and mudras can help create a deeper connection\nwith our body, the earth and the air around us.\n\n\"What is a Mudra\" you ask?\nLong story short; Mudra in Sanskrit means Mark/Seal/Gesture. These gestures\noccur throughout the practice of yoga and meditation.\n\nThere are probably many mudras you already use that you may not even be aware\nof; such as Anjali Mudra, also known as \"hands at heart center\".\n\nThe use of Mudras is to channel energy and move it through the body in specific\nways, and to accomplish specific purposes.\n\nIn the meditation below we will be using Bhu Mudra\nBhu Mudra is a grounding Mudra that is called the “gesture of the Earth.” This\nMudra encourages a sense of stability in the body and the mind. This Mudra is\nbest suited for seated postures as the connection of the Mudra to the earth.\n\nBhu Mudra-Bring the ring and the pinkie finger in under the thumb, with the\nindex and the middle finger extended. The index and middle finger will make\ncontact with the earth, lightly. Try to not press into the ground, of feel\nheavy.\n\nBhu MudraTry this grounding meditation below, great for fall and winter!\n 1. Sit in a comfortable seat with your sit bones rooted on the ground and a\n    long spine.\n 2. Hand and arms come to BHU MUDRA. Root your ‘peace’ fingers (pointer and\n    middle fingers) into the ground with your arms straight out to the sides as\n    you sit on the floor (or press peace fingers into the centers of your\n    thighs).\n 3. Notice your natural breath, perhaps sensing it dropping down into your belly\n    and pelvis to assist in rooting and grounding you.\n 4. Hold your breath for 5-10 natural breaths to start, increasing over time if\n    you like.\n 5. State this affirmation three times out loud, then silently as you breathe. \n    “My Roots run deep, I am supported by the earth\".\n\nThis Mudra and meditation connects you with your physical body to the Earth.\n\nInstills feeling secure, safe and grounded.\n\nCan help to reduce stress, anxiety, and frenetic energy.",

I froze over 175 oz of\nbreast milk by the time I was ready to leave CA. In my mind, I was super worried\nabout it defrosting and losing it all on the flight home. So I did what everyone\ndoes when looking for an answer to a question, I went straight to google.\n\nDo I ship it home? I researched shipping it over dry ice. but things I read said\ndry ice can change the taste of your milk and who knows what could happen in\ntransit etc.\n\nDo I check it? Should I pay to check it in a cooler? I had a layover in AZ and\nwhat if it got lost or my flight was delayed? I couldn't chance not being able\nto get to my luggage.\n\nDo I carry it on? All my research was pointing to carrying it on. If I froze it,\npacked the cooler tight enough, It would have the best chance at staying frozen\n(Plus I could always find ice in a desperate situation). I learned as long as\nthe breast milk is still slushy you can refreeze it and it is still good.\n\nSo I carried it on! All 175oz of breastmilk.\n\n175oz of breast milk in all its gloryCarrying on breast milk; TSA and airport\nexperience\nThe day before leaving we went to Walmart and purchases a soft cooler that would\nfit all the frozen milk. I made sure it was a super isolated cooler and easy to\ncarry.\n\nThe morning before we left, I packed all the frozen milk tight in a few ziplock\nbags. I placed ice packs on the bottom and top of the cooler. Even stuffing some\ntowels in there to make sure the cooler had no open-air space.\n\nAfter we packed the car, we were off to the airport to see how TSA would respond\nto my carry-on milk stash!\n\nDrew and I both have TSA pre-check. Which is a really good thing to have when\nyou are caring on that much breastmilk. With TSA pre they have already vetted\nyou as a \"safe traveler\" and more lax going through the checkpoint.\n\nI informed the TSA agents at every point that I was caring on breastmilk and\nmedical device equipment for pumping.\n\nTSA pulled my two coolers aside after they went through the x-ray scanner.\n\n 1. One cooler was packed with all the frozen milk that I would not open for 9\n    hours till we arrived home.\n 2. The 2nd cooler was for all my freshly pumped milk and pump parts during my\n    flights. This cooler would be opened and closed.\n\nTSA was extremely nice and happy to help me get through the checkpoint quickly.\nThey informed me that frozen milk is ideal when caring-on. It is the unfrozen\nmilk that causes more issues and takes more time to check.\n\nThank goodness I froze most of the milk before leaving!\n\nConclusion & Recap\n 1. See a lactation consultant to understand your pump schedule and routine. My\n    suggestion is joining the community at Balancedbreastfeeding.com\n    [https://balancedbreastfeeding.com/] with Katie Madden.\n 2. Get a portable pump. My recommendation is the closed system Freemie Cups\n    [https://freemie.com/collections/freemie-cups-for-your-pump/products/freemie-closed-system-collection-cup-set] \n    and a Bellababy\n    [https://www.amazon.com/Bellababy-Electric-Hanging-Adpaters-Changers/dp/B07TD4P8DS] \n    pocket portable breast pump. It costs around $145 in total.\n 3. Fuck lactation rooms, pump wherever you want. Do not spend your valuable\n    vacation time alone in a room pumping. Walking around, on the airplane, at\n    the pool, out at restaurants, on the golf course, WHEREVER!\n    #normalizepumping\n 4. Get TSA Pre-Check, Freeze your milk, and carry it on. The TSA manager\n    informed me that frozen breastmilk is a much faster process for them then\n    unfrozen milk. so my recommendation is to freeze everything and pack it in a\n    separate cooler that stays closed for the entire trip! let them know exactly\n    what you have in your coolers and tell them to use clean gloves and work\n    quickly while checking your coolers. If you are kind to them they are super\n    happy to oblige!\n 5. Last but not least and probably the most important; enjoy, relax and have\n    fun! Make your pumping experience a game; and ask yourself, \"where else can\n    I pump?\"!\n\nPumping and hiking? Sure... why not.",

When we barely even know who he is and if we even want to actually date him. At this stage of dating you should be testing him out. **Your attitude should be \\\"why do you deserve me\\\".** You need to show him that you have an abundant amount of potential men you could be dating in your back pocket and he is the lucky one you are giving a chance to. And if he can’t show up at the level you are at, than it's on to the next one!\\nAt this beginning stage you really should be just sitting back and watching who he is, how he treats you, and how he treats other people. Remember until maybe the 3rd date he is a complete stranger. Ladies, You can’t be in love with a man this early in the game. Control your feelings, protect your hearts and have high standards for the men that you decide to date.\\n## Mistake #2: Do not drop your life for a man you just started dating\\nThe second mistake I see is, woman tend to drop their life for a date. For example when a girl starts dating a guy she likes, what does she usually do? Stops hanging out with friends, sits by her phone waiting to be asked out, clears her calendar just in-case he wants to go out on Saturday. NOOOOOO…. **Remember your life is full**. This person has not proven that they are worth you canceling plans or even having a weekend date yet. Those weekend “holy days” if you will, are for really special people in your life! **Do not cancel your plans for a man that you just started dating,** in-fact if he calls on Thursday and asks you out Friday night, let him know you already have plans. Tell him that if he wants to go out, it is usually better to plan something with you in advance because your schedule books up fast. **Set your standards from the beginning.** If he is the man for you he will respect that and ask you out for Saturday night.\\n## Mistake #3: Do not sleep with them\\nMistake number three, Oh Ladies and this is a doozy, **do not sleep with them**. I think woman sometimes think that a guy will not stay unless you sleep with them after the third date. I say, isn’t it better if on date three, you say good night with a kiss and see if he calls you and asks you out for date 4?\\nThere are no rules on this. I have waited and not waited but the fact is. If you sleep with them that doesn’t mean they will commit to you. Wait until you are in a committed relationship. Then you both have decided that it is worth the next step and you protect yourself from a lot more pain if it doesn't end up working out.\\n## I will close this post with some little tid-bits of brilliant insight\\n**Men need to feel like you are a challenge.** They need to feel like you don’t just go out with anyone that asks for your number. They need to feel like they are special because you chose to give them a chance. Let them fight for your time, let them wonder if you like them, let them chase you and show you they are worthy of you.\\n**Stay in that beautiful feminine energy.** Just sit back, be open, relaxed, and light. Let them take care of you. If he is the right man. He will rise to the challenge and do the work. If he is the wrong man, he will fall away, and it is your job to let him.\\n**There is no need to convince anyone to be with you.** If you start convincing some one to be with you now, that will be the pattern of your relationship, and who wants that? you will see who is right and who is wrong if you just lean back, observe his actions and except who they are at face value, not who you want them to be.\\n# What mistakes have you made in the past when first dating some one?\\nShare your story, experience or comments below!

            "plaintext": "Mistake #1: Stop trying to prove you're worthy of him\nOne mistake I see in woman often (and I have been know to do this in my past as\nwell.) is when we start dating a guy, we try way too hard to prove we are worthy\nof him. When we barely even know who he is and if we even want to actually date\nhim. At this stage of dating you should be testing him out. Your attitude should\nbe \"why do you deserve me\". You need to show him that you have an abundant\namount of potential men you could be dating in your back pocket and he is the\nlucky one you are giving a chance to. And if he can’t show up at the level you\nare at, than it's on to the next one!\nAt this beginning stage you really should be just sitting back and watching who\nhe is, how he treats you, and how he treats other people. Remember until maybe\nthe 3rd date he is a complete stranger. Ladies, You can’t be in love with a man\nthis early in the game. Control your feelings, protect your hearts and have high\nstandards for the men that you decide to date.\n\nMistake #2: Do not drop your life for a man you just started dating\nThe second mistake I see is, woman tend to drop their life for a date. For\nexample when a girl starts dating a guy she likes, what does she usually do?\nStops hanging out with friends, sits by her phone waiting to be asked out,\nclears her calendar just in-case he wants to go out on Saturday. NOOOOOO…. \nRemember your life is full. This person has not proven that they are worth you\ncanceling plans or even having a weekend date yet. Those weekend “holy days” if\nyou will, are for really special people in your life! Do not cancel your plans\nfor a man that you just started dating, in-fact if he calls on Thursday and asks\nyou out Friday night, let him know you already have plans. Tell him that if he\nwants to go out, it is usually better to plan something with you in advance\nbecause your schedule books up fast. Set your standards from the beginning. If\nhe is the man for you he will respect that and ask you out for Saturday night.\n\nMistake #3: Do not sleep with them\nMistake number three, Oh Ladies and this is a doozy, do not sleep with them. I\nthink woman sometimes think that a guy will not stay unless you sleep with them\nafter the third date. I say, isn’t it better if on date three, you say good\nnight with a kiss and see if he calls you and asks you out for date 4?\nThere are no rules on this. I have waited and not waited but the fact is. If you\nsleep with them that doesn’t mean they will commit to you. Wait until you are in\na committed relationship. Then you both have decided that it is worth the next\nstep and you protect yourself from a lot more pain if it doesn't end up working\nout.\n\nI will close this post with some little tid-bits of brilliant insight\nMen need to feel like you are a challenge. They need to feel like you don’t just\ngo out with anyone that asks for your number. They need to feel like they are\nspecial because you chose to give them a chance. Let them fight for your time,\nlet them wonder if you like them, let them chase you and show you they are\nworthy of you.\nStay in that beautiful feminine energy. Just sit back, be open, relaxed, and\nlight. Let them take care of you. If he is the right man. He will rise to the\nchallenge and do the work. If he is the wrong man, he will fall away, and it is\nyour job to let him.\nThere is no need to convince anyone to be with you. If you start convincing some\none to be with you now, that will be the pattern of your relationship, and who\nwants that? you will see who is right and who is wrong if you just lean back,\nobserve his actions and except who they are at face value, not who you want them\nto be.\n\nWhat mistakes have you made in the past when first dating some one?\nShare your story, experience or comments below!

With my pregnancy coming to its final month. I want to make sure I document the events and feelings I have along the way. Along with embodying the energy I want to attract into my life now and moving forward.\\nSo let's just dive in shall we?\\n# The 4 daily steps for the challenge are as follows:\\n## Step 1: Meditate for at least 10 minutes\\nMeditating everyday is great but try splitting up your meditation into steps.\\n\\nUse the first few minutes of your meditation to **center and focus on just your breath**. Connect body and mind by just noticing the present moment and your breathing.2. During the second part of your meditation, **focus on embodying the life you want to attract.** Focus on how you want to FEEL during the day and the person you want to be. Then visualize and embody being that person and feeling that way already.3. Lastly, ask the universe for abundance in all things and signs to get where you want to be. **Mantra: \\\"I open myself up for new opportunities to become available to me\\\"**\\n> During this attraction meditation “I Impose my image on the world, not the worlds image on me.”\\n## Step 2: Journal\\nRight after you meditate, when your mind is in a good place and your energy is at its best, write it all down. **Who are you, who do you want to be, how do you want to feel, share your fears, acknowledge how your body feels, where is your mind, the things you are grateful for, even what you did yesterday.** Anything and everything that comes to your mind, write it down and put it out there.\\n\\nAfter you are done acknowledging and accepting, then surrender to the universe for it's guidance and ask for abundance.

With my pregnancy coming to its final\nmonth. I want to make sure I document the events and feelings I have along the\nway. Along with embodying the energy I want to attract into my life now and\nmoving forward.\nSo let's just dive in shall we?\n\nThe 4 daily steps for the challenge are as follows:\nStep 1: Meditate for at least 10 minutes\nMeditating everyday is great but try splitting up your meditation into steps.\n\nUse the first few minutes of your meditation to center and focus on just your\nbreath. Connect body and mind by just noticing the present moment and your\nbreathing.2. During the second part of your meditation, focus on embodying the\nlife you want to attract. Focus on how you want to FEEL during the day and the\nperson you want to be. Then visualize and embody being that person and feeling\nthat way already.3. Lastly, ask the universe for abundance in all things and\nsigns to get where you want to be. Mantra: \"I open myself up for new\nopportunities to become available to me\"\n\n> During this attraction meditation “I Impose my image on the world, not the\nworlds image on me.”\n\n\nStep 2: Journal\nRight after you meditate, when your mind is in a good place and your energy is\nat its best, write it all down. Who are you, who do you want to be, how do you\nwant to feel, share your fears, acknowledge how your body feels, where is your\nmind, the things you are grateful for, even what you did yesterday. Anything and\neverything that comes to your mind, write it down and put it out there.\n\nAfter you are done acknowledging and accepting, then surrender to the universe\nfor it's guidance and ask for abundance. Knowing it has a greater plan for you.\n\nStep 3: Feel grateful at least 3 times per day\nSet 3 times per day to feel grateful and really FEEL and embody it in all of\nyour senses.\n\nSet a timer on your phone or computer for 3 different times during the day.-\nWhen your alarm goes off, stop and find something to be grateful for, small or\nlarge.

            "plaintext": "I have walked you through many of my fears of pregnancy the past few months as\nmy new baby arrives. All of them leading to the peak of my journey. This post is\nvulnerable for me to discuss, however, I feel it is necessary to shed light on a\nsubject that is so black and white in so many peoples eyes. I think it is\nessential to understand the depth of what \"having a choice\" for a woman actually\nmeans. I ask that you read this post with openness and understanding. It has\ntaken me many years to own this story and my hope is that I may be able to share\na side of abortion that is rarely seen or discussed.\n\nPart 1\nRemembering this time “like it was yesterday” is an understatement. It has\nplayed over and over in my mind, like a really bad song that you can't seem to\nget out of your head. What could I have done different? Why was this the\noutcome? Why did it take such a tragedy to shake me awake?\n\n> This is a story of confusion, loss, sadness, and awakening. It is a story that\ntook me years to honor and ultimately come to love. It is a story of strength\nand survival. It is my journey, my truth, and if you have come to join me, it\nmeans you too may have gone through your own individual journey to\nconsciousness. So, I welcome you.\nI was 32 when I became pregnant with my first child. It wasn’t an accident. I\ndecided I wanted a family and nothing was going to stop me from having it. I had\nalways pushed through everything in life, picked myself up, dusted off and moved\nforward. This was no different. I knew it would be hard, I was also unsure of\nthe level of support I would have from my husband. But I wanted the love of a\nchild so bad in my life that I knew I had to go for it. So I did.\n\nOne try, and there it was. I missed my period. It was the first time I had ever\nbought a pregnancy test. I waited for my husband to get home from work and told\nhim I was taking the test. It was the longest few minutes of my life. As I\nwaited in the bathroom, alone, my anxiety and panic started to overwhelm me. I\ncould barely breathe and felt faint. My body started to shake as the test\nrevealed it's truth. I collapsed on the floor of the bathroom as my life flashed\nin front of my eyes. It was positive.\n\nI gathered myself together off the floor of the bathroom and picked myself up as\nI had done many times before. Hating myself for feeling upset about the positive\nresult. I made it into the bedroom where my husband was changing for his run and\ntold him the news. I told him I was really scared, I told him I was worried and\nneeded his support with getting through this. He glared at me from across the\nroom with the emptiest eyes I had ever seen and said “This is what you wanted,\nnow you will have to deal with it”. He stood up and walked out of the room. “It\nis what I wanted”, I repeated in my head as I fell to the bedroom floor sobbing.\nWhy did I feel like I had made the worst decision of my life? If it was\nsomething I wanted, why did it feel wrong? Why did I feel trapped and\nsuffocated? And then the answer came; it flashed across my mind, clear as day.\nThe voice said “you can not do this, get out, save me and save yourself”.\n\nI shook my head vigorously hoping the visions and voices would go away. But the\nfeeling in my being was so strong that I just couldn’t ignore it. That night, as\nI tried to sleep, the voice became louder. “You cannot do this, get out, save me\nand save yourself”. I got up in the darkness and walked to my office. My monitor\nilluminated the room as I started my search. I began to type; G-O-O-G-L-E;\nRETURN Key. A-B-O-R-T-I-O-N; RETURN Key.\n\nPart 2\nAs I searched the internet in the darkness that night, my panic started to\nlessen. I jotted down phone numbers and doctors and reviews. The voice started\nto go away and my breathing became calm once again.\n\nThe rising sun indicated that I had been researching all night. It was time to\nshut my eyes and relax before having the conversation with my husband. “I wonder\nhow that will go”, I thought to myself as I drifted to sleep.\n\nIt was Saturday when I woke. I walked down the stairs to find my husband sitting\nin his normal spot. I started talking. I told him everything I was feeling, the\nresearch I had done, the options we had... everything. I don’t know why I\nthought that telling him would comfort me. I don’t know why I thought that he\nwould hold me and tell me everything would be ok and we were in this together.\nBut yet I hoped for it. I waited for it more than anything in the world. \nInstead, he told me with a cold stern voice “I don’t care either way what you\ndo”. He told me I couldn’t tell anyone, no one could know because I was an\nembarrassment. He told me that if I decided to continue with the pregnancy my\nfamily would have no part of the child's life; my mom and my brothers would not\nbe a part of helping to raise this child. All of these words felt like knives\ngoing straight through my stomach. I wanted to throw up. I felt completely alone\nand the voice screamed at me again “you can not do this, get out, save me and\nsave yourself”.\n\nSo I told no one (except for one of my dearest friends) and started calling the\nplaces I had researched. (Side note: If you are under the impression abortions\nare done anywhere and everywhere; I have news for you, they aren’t).\n\n> “We don’t do them unless there is something wrong with the fetus.”. “Did your\ntest results come back positive for a genetic disease?”. “We only do them if you\nare a patient here.”.\nCall after call I was rejected. The cold reality is people are not nice when it\ncomes to these matters. They judge, are very harsh, and have no empathy for\nsomeone who is “killing a baby”.\n\nAfter a while, I finally got a hold of a division of one of the major hospitals\nin Philadelphia that preforms abortions and scheduled an appointment. Up until\nthis point, I was unaware that there was a waiting period to go forward with an\nabortion. After the hospital confirmed the pregnancy at 6 weeks, PA required a\nmandatory wait period of 2 weeks to make sure I was of \"right mind\" before\ncontinuing on with the procedure. As if having an abortion isn’t traumatic\nenough, the waiting is catastrophic to your psyche. Those 4 weeks of waiting\nwere debilitating.\n\nFinally, the day came for the procedure. When I got home, I was emotionally,\nphysically, and mentally exhausted and my body was very confused. My hormones\nand emotions started to go crazy.\n\n> Now in hindsight, I know I must have been suffering from extreme postpartum\ndepression for the months that fallowed my abortion.\nDepressed, not eating or sleeping, watching as friend after friend excitingly\nannounce their pregnancies. All while I cried inside and stayed silent; ashamed,\nguilty and beaten down. I was a failure.\n\nThe sadness continued. April passed, when I would have given birth, and I\nstarted thinking to myself “why did I do such a drastic thing? This was\nsomething I wanted and still want. What was wrong with me?\".\n\nSo I started on a journey to figure out the truth. I began questioning\neverything, I started going to therapy to figure out the “why” to my story and\neventually, I found my answers. The \"why\" I unearthed was nothing I had ever\nexpected to find. It had little to do with the abortion and so much more to do\nwith the emotional and mental abuse I was suffering from in my marriage.\n\nI always say \"That Baby Saved My Life\". Getting pregnant was an awakening for\nme. It shook me to my core; I could no longer dismiss what was going on nor pick\nmyself up from the abuse I was living with every day.\n\nI left my marriage almost a year to the day after having my abortion.\n\nAs I look back now, I know the abortion was the right choice for me. I have come\nto peace with the decision I had to make for the both of us. In the end though,\nI know it was that baby who saved my life. Every April, I smile and think of how\nthe child and I saved each other, knowing none of it was in vain.\n\nWhat I have learned through this whole journey about abortion and the right to\nchoose is this:\n\n> Sometimes abortion isn’t about the loss of life. Sometimes it's about saving a\nlife.\nThank you for allowing me to share my story. I hope It shed light on the gray\narea of this topic.\nNot everyones path to pregnancy is straight. Some times that path is messy, with\nsharp edges and sinkholes. But having choice is a right everyone should have for\nthe health of their own body and mind. I am glad I had the choice.\n\nLove and light to everyone on their own journeys.\n\nThis photo is of me today, happily 33 weeks pregnant. 4 years after my abortion.",

It was him, all along.\n\nAt that moment when seeing the list again, I realized I had manifested the love\nof my life with a single piece of paper. That day I had surrendered all my\ndesires for a partner to something greater than me (now I call this higher power\nthe Universe). The day I wrote that list; I let it go, unknowing the universe\nhad my back now and also a blueprint for the person I was searching for. I had\nmanifested Drew by knowing I was enough and my desires were enough.\n\nBoth the Universe and I unknowingly made a pact that day and 6 months later Drew\nand I found partnership in each other.\n\nI will leave you with this:\n> Where your thoughts go, energy flows.\nThink \"lack\" and that will become your energy. Think \"abundance, I can, I will\"\nand notice it propel you to the greatest things life has to offer.\n\nHave you used manifesting to attract abundance in your life?\nAs always share any thoughts comments or insight below. I would love to hear\nyour story. How have you reset your life? How has it changed you?",

After using the Ameda for about 6 weeks and having a lot of problems,\nmy lactation consultant recommended using the Medela Pump. My Sister-in-law, the\nsaint that she is, let me barrow her Medela to test out the difference.\n\nThe second I turned on the Medela, I realized I had been using a torture device\ndisguised as an Ameda Breast pump for the past 6 weeks! The difference was night\nand day! I 100% recommend the Medela over the Ameda; No Hesitation!!!\n\nIn conclusion... and my honest opinion\n> I, along with every breastfeeding mom out there, am absolutely NUTS! (in a good\nway of course)\n8 weeks later and I am \"crazily\" still at it! My body seems to be adjusting to\nthe \"New Normal\". However, I give myself full permission at any time to pull the\nplug on this whole operation!\n\nI set small goals for myself with this whole breastfeeding silliness. \"Can I\nmake it 2 weeks? 2 months?\". My next goal is 3 months. With each goal that I set\nand achieve; I celebrate!\n\nMaybe I will make it to the coveted 6 months or even 1 year of breastfeeding. Or\nmaybe I will decide I am done at 3 months. The bottom line is, for all you\nbreastfeeding-amazing-super-moms out there, YOU ALL ROCK! No matter how long or\nshort you did it for; that time can never be undone! SO BRAVO!\n\n- AND -\n\nFor all you Mommas that are super self-aware and knew breastfeeding wasn't right\nfor you from the get-go; YOU ROCK TOO!\n\n> Because keeping these little kiddos fed is no easy task regardless of how we\ndecide to do it!\nGoodness gracious, Who knew boobs were this complicated?!?!\nWishing all you Moms sleep and an abundant milk supply!\n\n(but not too \"abundant\", because that can cause serious issues...)",

            "plaintext": "Recently I traveled to Palm Springs, CA for 6 days! I am sure you are saying\n\"what's the big deal about that?\". This use to be a \"no big deal\" type of trip,\nback before I was a Mom. But now I have a 6-month-old and I am still nursing and\nbreastfeeding! Making deciding to travel WITHOUT my baby a little more\ndifficult.\n\nYou see, If I wanted to continue to breastfeed/nurse my child and also travel; I\nhad to figure out a way to do both. So this meant using all the new pumping\ntechnology and resources I had around me to MAKE IT HAPPEN!\n\nHere is a guide to my individual experience. What worked for me, and my\nthoughts/feelings around traveling, flying, pumping, and packing/freezing\nbreastmilk.\n\nI hope this post helps Moms take the leap to travel while breastfeeding WITHOUT\nBABY. I hope this also helps start to NORMALIZE pumping in public. No, I don't\nmean sitting in your car or a lactation room or bathroom stall; covering and\nhiding away to pump for 20 to 30 minutes, 6 to 7 times per day. I mean pumping\nwhile walking around, at restaurants, playing golf, hiking, etc.\n\nA huge part of breastfeeding is pumping. Normalizing pumping in public is just\nas important as normalizing nursing in public.\n\nGet a lactation consultant\nSpeak with a professional about your desire to travel while breastfeeding and\ncome up with a plan together.\n\nI was fortunate to have the worlds best lactation consultant Katie Madden by my\nside through this journey. Katie owns Balanced Breastfeeding\n[https://balancedbreastfeeding.com/] and understands the importance of each\nindividual's different needs and desires.\n\nWe discussed several things before making my decision to travel. Some questions\nyou may want to ask your consultant:\n\n 1. How many times should you pump each day to keep your supply up?\n 2. When are the best times to pump for your body and supply level?\n 3. What are the TSA and Airline policies for breastmilk, coolers, pumping\n    devices, etc.?\n\nPumping in public\nI reached a 4-month goal and decided to treat myself to the closed system\nFreemie Cups\n[https://freemie.com/collections/freemie-cups-for-your-pump/products/freemie-closed-system-collection-cup-set]\nand a Bellababy pocket portable breast pump\n[https://www.amazon.com/Bellababy-Electric-Hanging-Adpaters-Changers/dp/B07TD4P8DS]\n. This set up cost me around $145. which is way less than the $500 Willow\nPortable pump and it got me up and moving while pumping! Which was my ultimate\ngoal.\n\nCoffee and pumping... classicGolfing and pumping... classicHaving this mindset\nwhen I started my trip helped tremendously! I was able to pump while walking\naround the airport, on the planes, checking into our villa, In the car, in\nrestaurants, by the pool, playing golf, drinking coffee on the porch, on hikes\nin Joshua Tree National Park. You name it, and I probably pumped there! And why\nthe hell not! I had limited time away and hell if I was going to sit in a room,\nby myself, pumping for 30 minutes 6 to 7 times a day! That's over 3.5 hours per\nday wasted pumping. UMMMM NOPE!\n\nThis set up worked perfect and if you want to feel free while you pump. I\nrecommend you splurge! Buy the portable pump NOW. Do not wait. You will not\nregret it!\n\nAirport lactation rooms\nOk, so I spotted a few of these \"lactation rooms\" in the airports. My thoughts\non these rooms are as follows:\n\nOne lactation room was at Philadelphia International Airport and it looked like\na nicer version of a porta-potty. I looked inside this tin box to find a decent\nroom if privacy is what you are looking for. But why are they asking mothers to\nnurse and pump in private? No thanks. I think I will just sit in an open area or\nwalk around while I pump in the airport. I may even grab something to eat or a\ndrink at one of the airport restaurants and pump there. Because my time is\nprecious.\n\n> Thanks for the option to close me in a metal box for 30 minutes Philly (insert\nroll-eye emoji here). Super generous of you.\nAnother lactation room was in Palm Springs, CA Airport. If you have never been\nto this airport, you should go. It is a beautiful outdoor, open-air airport with\ngardens and benches. There is even a playground for kids and grass to walk your\ndog on! I am sure you are thinking \"well, they have a beautiful lactation area\nfor nursing and pumping mothers.\"...\n\n...Um nope! Right next to the woman's bathroom was a lactation room. I walked\nfrom the beautiful, sunny, 70-degree weather; into a tiled lactation room that\nresembled the bathrooms next door. It was cold dark and uncomfortable. It had\none tile bench built into the wall with a plug. That was it!\n\n> Why would I decide to pump in a cold dark room, when I could sit on a bench in\nthe sun looking at the beautiful flowers and breathing the fresh air? Are the\npeople that create these rooms mad?\nPalm Spring Airport, CAI will scream it from the rooftop again! \"Breastfeeding,\nnursing, and pumping are not like using the bathroom!!!!\"\n\nMy conclusion on airport lactation rooms; \"Um thanks, but actually no thanks!\" I\nwill pump and/or nurse wherever I want. If someone is uncomfortable with that.\nThen I suggest they go sit in the damn lactation rooms.\n\nPacking and traveling with breast milk\nPumping for a week straight produces A LOT of milk! I froze over 175 oz of\nbreast milk by the time I was ready to leave CA. In my mind, I was super worried\nabout it defrosting and losing it all on the flight home. So I did what everyone\ndoes when looking for an answer to a question, I went straight to google.\n\nDo I ship it home? I researched shipping it over dry ice. but things I read said\ndry ice can change the taste of your milk and who knows what could happen in\ntransit etc.\n\nDo I check it? Should I pay to check it in a cooler? I had a layover in AZ and\nwhat if it got lost or my flight was delayed? I couldn't chance not being able\nto get to my luggage.\n\nDo I carry it on? All my research was pointing to carrying it on. If I froze it,\npacked the cooler tight enough, It would have the best chance at staying frozen\n(Plus I could always find ice in a desperate situation). I learned as long as\nthe breast milk is still slushy you can refreeze it and it is still good.\n\nSo I carried it on! All 175oz of breastmilk.\n\n175oz of breast milk in all its gloryCarrying on breast milk; TSA and airport\nexperience\nThe day before leaving we went to Walmart and purchases a soft cooler that would\nfit all the frozen milk. I made sure it was a super isolated cooler and easy to\ncarry.\n\nThe morning before we left, I packed all the frozen milk tight in a few ziplock\nbags. I placed ice packs on the bottom and top of the cooler. Even stuffing some\ntowels in there to make sure the cooler had no open-air space.\n\nAfter we packed the car, we were off to the airport to see how TSA would respond\nto my carry-on milk stash!\n\nDrew and I both have TSA pre-check. Which is a really good thing to have when\nyou are caring on that much breastmilk. With TSA pre they have already vetted\nyou as a \"safe traveler\" and more lax going through the checkpoint.\n\nI informed the TSA agents at every point that I was caring on breastmilk and\nmedical device equipment for pumping.\n\nTSA pulled my two coolers aside after they went through the x-ray scanner.\n\n 1. One cooler was packed with all the frozen milk that I would not open for 9\n    hours till we arrived home.\n 2. The 2nd cooler was for all my freshly pumped milk and pump parts during my\n    flights. This cooler would be opened and closed.\n\nTSA was extremely nice and happy to help me get through the checkpoint quickly.\nThey informed me that frozen milk is ideal when caring-on. It is the unfrozen\nmilk that causes more issues and takes more time to check.\n\nThank goodness I froze most of the milk before leaving!\n\nConclusion & Recap\n 1. See a lactation consultant to understand your pump schedule and routine. My\n    suggestion is joining the community at Balancedbreastfeeding.com\n    [https://balancedbreastfeeding.com/] with Katie Madden.\n 2. Get a portable pump. My recommendation is the closed system Freemie Cups\n    [https://freemie.com/collections/freemie-cups-for-your-pump/products/freemie-closed-system-collection-cup-set] \n    and a Bellababy\n    [https://www.amazon.com/Bellababy-Electric-Hanging-Adpaters-Changers/dp/B07TD4P8DS] \n    pocket portable breast pump. It costs around $145 in total.\n 3. Fuck lactation rooms, pump wherever you want. Do not spend your valuable\n    vacation time alone in a room pumping. Walking around, on the airplane, at\n    the pool, out at restaurants, on the golf course, WHEREVER!\n    #normalizepumping\n 4. Get TSA Pre-Check, Freeze your milk, and carry it on. The TSA manager\n    informed me that frozen breastmilk is a much faster process for them then\n    unfrozen milk. so my recommendation is to freeze everything and pack it in a\n    separate cooler that stays closed for the entire trip! let them know exactly\n    what you have in your coolers and tell them to use clean gloves and work\n    quickly while checking your coolers. If you are kind to them they are super\n    happy to oblige!\n 5. Last but not least and probably the most important; enjoy, relax and have\n    fun! Make your pumping experience a game; and ask yourself, \"where else can\n    I pump?\"!\n\nPumping and hiking? Sure... why not.",

All new pages need to be developed by Drew. This\nkeeps the site running blazing fast for your users :)\n\nComments\nThe comments on your blog pages are powered by Commento.io\n[https://commento.io/]. It's an open source commenting system that prioritizes\nprivacy over tracking. We run a copy of their code on our own infrastructure so\nwe own all of our data. That's important to note if someone comes knocking and\nwant's to remove their comments. Below is a picture they provided that does a\nnice job of detailing their features.\n\nSigning into Commento\nCommento only allows us to have one administrator but we can have many\nmoderators. You won't have access to the technical settings, but you'll have all\nof the privileges to moderate comments. In order to do that, you'll need to sign\nin.\n\nGo to any blog post page and scroll to the bottom. Click on the \"Login\" link at\nthe top right of the text box.\n\nYou'll see a dialog that will prompt you to login. Enter your login credentials\n(stored in 1Password) and click \"Login\".\n\nFrom here, you'll see the below screen where you will either see your picture or\nan avatar placeholder.\n\nAfter following these steps, you're now able to moderate comments.\n\nModerated comments\nAll comments are moderated, which means that nothing will be added to our\ncommenting database without your or my approval.\n\nWhen a comment is made, you will receive an email letting you know first, that a\ncomment was made and second, asking you to take action on that email. Below is\nwhat that email will look like.\n\nThere are 3 links below the title that say \"approve\", \"delete\", and \"context\".\nYou can approve the comment right away by clicking approve. If you want to see\nthe comment in it's context, click on the \"context\" link. You'll be directed to\nthe blog post and scrolled automatically to the comment that is in review. It\nwill show up as highlighted in yellow. See below:\n\nFrom here, you can do a few things. First, if you like it, you can click on the \ngreen checkmark to approve the post. If you don't like it, you can click on the \nred trash can to delete the post.\n\nYou as a moderator will always see the trash icon as that you have full control\nover the comments in your blog.\n\nBlog contributors / authors\nHow to add other authors\nIn order for other people to create content, you'll need to add them to the\nGhost dashboard.\n\nFirst, login to the Ghost app on your computer, and then click on \"staff\" on the\nleft hand side navigation bar.\n\nNext, click on the green \"Invite people\" button in the top right hand corner of\nthe screen.\n\nFrom here, add their email address that they provided you and then set their\nrole. The role should most likely be \"Contributor\". If your not sure, you can\nread more about the roles here: https://ghost.org/faq/managing-your-team/\n\nRegarding authors showing up in the website\nOnly authors that have created content and have it successfully published will\nappear in the authors section.
